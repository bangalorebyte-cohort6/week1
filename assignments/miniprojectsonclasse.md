## Weekend Mini Projects using Classes

Project 1: Electronic Commerce Application. 

You need to create the foundations of an e-commerce engine
for a B2C (business-to-consumer) retailer. You need to have a class for a customer
called User, a class for items in inventory called Item, and a shopping cart class called
Cart. Items go in Carts, and Users can have multiple Carts. Also, multiple items can
go into Carts, including more than one of any single item.

Project 2: Chat Rooms. 

You have been pretty disappointed at the current quality of chat room
applications and vow to create your own, start up a new Internet company, obtain
venture capital funding, integrate advertisement into your chat program, quintuple
revenues in a six-month period, go public, and retire. However, none of this will
happen if you do not have a pretty cool chat application.
There are three classes you will need: a Message class containing a message string and
any additional information such as broadcast or single recipient, and a User class that
contains all the information for a person entering your chat rooms. To really wow the
VCs to get your start-up capital, you add a class Room that represents a more
sophisticated chat system where users can create separate "rooms" within the chat
area and invite others to join. Extra credit: Develop graphical user interface (GUI)
applications for the users.

Project 3: Stock Portfolio Class. 

For each company, your database tracks the name, ticker
symbol, purchase date, purchase price, and number of shares. Methods include: add
new symbol (new purchase), remove symbol (all shares sold), and YTD or Annual
Return performance for any or all symbols given a current price (and date).
