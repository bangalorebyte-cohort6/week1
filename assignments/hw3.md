### Part 1

The datetime module provides data and time objects and a rich set of methods and operators. Read the documentation [here](https://docs.python.org/3/library/datetime.html). Submit the following in a file named `date.py`.

1. Use the datetime module to write a program that gets the current date and prints the day of the week.
2. Write a program that takes a birthday as input and prints the user’s age and the number of days, hours, minutes and seconds until their next birthday.
3. For two people born on different days, there is a day when one is twice as old as the other. That’s their Double Day. Write a program that takes two birthdays and computes their Double Day.
4. For a little more challenge, write the more general version that computes the day when one person is n times older than the other.

### Part 2

Battleship Game:

In this project you will build a simplified, one-player version of the classic board game Battleship! In this version, there will be a single ship hidden in a random location on a 5x5 grid. The player will have 10 guesses to try to sink the ship.
Use lists, conditionals, functions and function objects effectively to build the game.
